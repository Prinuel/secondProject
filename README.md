### What I learned

I learnt how to center text in rounded buttons, i also learnt that var has some issues and also learnt about the advent of let and const when declaring variables, i had a lot of issues not knowing where my problem was coming from so i also stumbled on console.log and arrow function and it really helped me.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
